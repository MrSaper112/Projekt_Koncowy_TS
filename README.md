# Simple Web Engine With Basic Shapes
## Installation

npx webpack serve
- open http://localhost:8080/
```
## How to use
Creating new shapes is done by developing predefined Classes (Plane, Sphere, Camera, Cube). Each shape has to be connected to Material, witch can be either texture or color. If Material is not chosen, the Class assigns it by default.
